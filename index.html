      <h3>Master's Student in Electrochemical Science and Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Anandajayarajan Udayakumar is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrochemical Science and Technology at the University of Oregon, where he contributes to the development and characterization of advanced Li-ion battery systems. His research involves the fabrication and testing of Li-ion coin and pouch cells, with a focus on electrochemical impedance modeling and cathode performance analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before joining the University of Oregon in Fall 2024, Anandajayarajan was a Teaching and Research Assistant at the University of Illinois Chicago, where he worked on an ARPA-E funded project to develop 3D-printed CO‚ÇÇ-breathable electrodes for Li-CO‚ÇÇ batteries. This work led to a notable reduction in discharge overpotential and offered key insights into next-generation energy storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        He earned his M.Tech. in Nanoscience and Technology from Pondicherry University, India, where his master's research resulted in three peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals. Prior to this, he completed a B.Tech. in Chemical and Electrochemical Engineering at CSIR-Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI), where he also engaged in research on pseudocapacitive energy storage using nanostructured carbon materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anandajayarajan also conducted research at Aalto University (Finland) and CECRI (India), where he employed advanced techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to analyze electrode materials. His work spans both experimental and computational methods, with expertise in tools like COMSOL, MATLAB, and Python for modeling and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        His academic trajectory reflects a strong commitment to energy materials research, with a particular focus on electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies.
